# Welcome to SpoonOS

Welcome to the **SpoonOS Code Cook Book** - your comprehensive guide to building intelligent agents with the SpoonOS Core Developer Framework.

## What is SpoonOS?

SpoonOS is an **Agentic Operating System for the Sentient Economy** - a next-generation AI agent framework designed specifically for Web3 developers. It provides a complete toolkit for building sentient, composable, and interoperable AI agents.

### Key Features

- 🧠 **ReAct Intelligent Agents** - Advanced agent architecture combining reasoning and action
- 🔧 **Custom Tool Ecosystem** - Modular tool system for easily extending agent capabilities
- 💬 **Multi-Model Support** - Compatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and more
- 🏗️ **Unified LLM Architecture** - Extensible provider system with automatic fallback
- 📊 **Enhanced Graph System** - LangGraph-inspired workflow orchestration
- 🌐 **Web3-Native Integration** - Built-in support for blockchain, DeFi, and decentralized protocols
- 🔌 **MCP Protocol** - Dynamic, protocol-driven tool invocation system
- 💻 **Interactive CLI** - Feature-rich command line interface
